        <p className=" leading-7 text-justify">
          Life is full of unexpected twists. At the time, these U-turns may seem
          overwhelming, difficult, or even insurmountable. However, its often
          through these moments of uncertainty and challenge that we find our
          true strength, values, and purpose. The Uturn concept encourages us to
          embrace these defining moments rather than fear them. Each U-turn
          represents a powerful transformation, a turning point where we can
          choose to evolve.

        <h2 className="  py-4 font-black">Real-Life Uturn Stories</h2>
        <p className=" leading-7 text-justify">
          Throughout history, individuals have experienced monumental U-turns
          that changed their lives and the world around them. Consider Steve
          Jobs return to Apple after being ousted from the company he helped
          create. That U-turn not only transformed his personal trajectory but
          also sparked one of the most innovative periods in tech history.
        </p>
        <p className=" leading-7 text-justify">
          On a more personal level, many of us have faced U-turnsâ€”whether it was
          a career shift, a sudden move to a new city, or the loss of a loved
          one. These experiences push us to reflect, adapt, and grow.
